# Zombie-Challenge 2

Get ready for the sequel to Zombie Challenge! This Node.js text adventure takes you through a house that is no longer inhabited... or is it? Bwahahaha!

Your goal is to kill the Alpha Zombie, located in one of the rooms. You can pick up various objects along the way, but be warned! You can only carry one weapon at a time, and any keys you pick up are flimsy!

To play, clone this repository and use the command "npm install" before running.

Good luck!
